Welcome to my webpage! I'm Mayank Gupta, a senior undergraduate in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. 

I have been working on developing newer Symbolic Regression techniques using Markov Chains, Ultra Reliable Low Latency communication using Reinforcement Learning and finetuning models for Hindi Song generation lately.

Along with this, I'm an amateur Photographer, an avid fan of Chess and F1.
